/*
Objective:
The objective of this experiment is to benchmark MRS on Card collection data using rxFastTrees model by evaluating runtimes across different modules of the code for different volumes of data

Steps involved:
Data Import - importing cards dataset from Test and Learn environment

Data wrangling - filtering out variables required for modelling, changing these variables to required data types and Standardisation of variables across the mean

Dataset split - spliting the the data into train and test data and performing undersampling to overcome imbalanced classes

Model development - developing rxFastTrees model with various parameters

Model validation - validating the prediction results using different evaluation techniques

Time calculation - calculating runtimes across different modules of the code by time wrapping each modules

N.B.: All the above modules (#1 to #5) are time-wrapped in order to calculate the execution time of each module. These runtimes are collated at the end of the script (#6) and taken out as output
*/

/*
1. Data Import
1.1. Set working directory and libraries
Functions used:

rxOptions() - the parameter numCoresToUse is used to specify the number of cores to be used by the script
